# CMS

This is a basic conent managment system.
With this system you can change the basic elements of a static website

It should look like typo3 without that much features. We can and we will add more features later.
Promised.

Like Ratan Tata said:
>A promise is a promise.

If you have some awesome ideas what we can change and/or add please tell use in this issue

The finished website should look like a mix out of medium.com and the finished version of "Web Design in 4 minutes" (Image in the example section)
