# CMS

This is a basic content managment system.
With this system you can change the basic elements of a static website

It should look like typo3 without that much features. We can and we will add more features later.
Promised.

Like Ratan Tata said:
>A promise is a promise.

If you have some awesome ideas what we can change and/or add please tell use in this issue
--> https://github.com/DevvitIO/CMS/issues/2

The finished website should look like a mix out of medium.com and the finished version of "Web Design in 4 minutes" (Image in the example section)

2.3.5-0041<br />
│ │ │  └────── build number<br />
│ │ └───────── patch level<br />
│ └─────────── minor release<br />
└───────────── major release<br />

The major release is a big change like a new library or complete rewrite or the first complete release when the software is
out of the early-access build.
The minor release is just a new feature.
The patch level is the build after little changes like bug fixes.
The build number starts at 0001 and increases after every merge. (1 merge = +1).

We will publish patch notes after every new release so you know what is new.


## Design

I refer to our Style Guide so you need what you have to do:

I created a first mockup of the final website.
This is just a summary of a bunch of idea from different people.

Our front-front-end site is finished and looks like this:
